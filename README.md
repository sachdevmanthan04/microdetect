# ðŸ§« Microplastic Detection using YOLOv5 (PyTorch)

This project uses a **YOLOv5 deep learning model** to detect **microplastics** in microscopic images.  
It automatically analyzes images, detects the number and position of microplastics, and outputs:
- âœ… An annotated image showing detection boxes  
- âœ… A JSON report showing detection details and total count
- best.pt is the trained model in colab
- test_model.py is the main python file to test the model
- there are some sample images present you can use it to test the model
